PRIMORDIAL:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
DONE  - Change input file format for various properties (include in menu)
DONE  - Make nplot respond to the call nplot input.txt with input.txt
          the input file
DONE  - Include two modes of node visualization (include in menu)


IMPORTANT:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
DONE  - In canvas.cpp, fix the visual decal bug occuring between
          the displayed depth and the color
DONE  - In canvas.cpp, drawz()-> make the z scale look smoother
DONE  - Fix the bug in main.cpp where #include "fonts.h" fails
DONE  - Set a minimum size for the nplot window
DONE  - Move the color/gray buttons to the scale menu
DONE  - Could move the + and - scale buttons to the menu Scale ->
          would make the scale look better
DONE	- In drawz subroutine, when "out of range" then fill it with a 
	    gray color..
DONE  - Change the fixed value for the menu bar width to something
          related to the font width.. Test this.
DONE  - When switching from i,j,k upaxis, there's a slight decal
          bug occuring when the number of nodes in k is small.
DONE  - Little bug when clicking on the z-depth range: slight decal
          between mouse cursor and printed value
DONE  - In the menu item File, include the line new_window and close_window, 
          which would give a new nplot with the same data structure
          (this seems a bit tricky though ;-))
DONE  - Give a much better Help in the help menu about the 1) button group,
          2) the menu, 3) navigation on canvas
DONE  - Give a help option activated by "nplot -help" in main.cpp related
          to the format of the input file in fortran, C, or pascal
DONE  - Include the menu item View->"Center xy-Canvas" and View->"Reset Zoom"
DONE  - Download the qt-1.40 library and see if everything compiles OK
DONE  - Create an INSTALL file giving info on the installation of NodPlot
DONE  - Create a README file drescribing nodplot 
DONE  - Call drawz() only when the required depth is different from the
          actual depth
DONE  - The drawz subroutine shows no update when mouse cursor is between
          nodes in xy canvas
DONE  - Write down the bash install script (file Install)
DONE  - bug in main.c where te input files templates for C-Pascal-Fortran
        do not work
DONE  - there's a bug in the view->proportional switch: it doesn't find
        properly the axis along which there are the most nodes: the bug
        was actually the fact that it assumed numpixelsref to be related
        to the wrong axis (x instead of y or vice-versa)..            
DONE  - the proportional spacing has been redefined to occupy the most
        space of the actual x-y plotting area
DONE  - the additional option -geometry is now supported
DONE  - make graphics go faster with line method in j-direction
DONE  - program a nicer algorithm to take care of the command-line options
DONE  - compile a static lib for qt and create a static executable


AESTHETICS:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
DONE  - Make the button group positioned down-right instead of
          middle-right
DONE  - Get rid of "out of range 1" and "out of range 2" in message box
DONE  - Make the message in message box more visually appealing
DONE  - Change the background color of the canvas to something similar
          to the background color of the drawz view
DONE  - Include a third mode of scale type (maybe steel blue?)
DONE	- In drawz subroutine, add a cute arrow pointing left where the 
	    depth is indicated	
DONE  - Increase the size of the fw and bw buttons 
DONE  - Add some control sequences to some menu items (like increase scale
          or decrease scale) 
DONE	- Change the shape of the scale in canvas
DONE  - Make the title of the nplot windows related to the property shown,
          whether the window is "mainwidget" or not..
DONE  - Include the name of the input file in the window title
DONE  - Change the shape of the crossed hairs in middle of canvas
DONE  - In the getdata class, the message is a push button, make this
          a "message button"
DONE  - When viewing the z-depth, make it appear *only* when inside
          canvas
DONE  - Put some radio buttons in menu View and Scale -> for some strange
          reason, this results in a core dumped when exiting nplot.
          note: with qt1.40, no crash.

CODE AESTHETICS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
DONE  - move subroutine input_data from main.cpp to transfo.cpp
      - in transfo.cpp subroutine find_pixel_from_node: shouldn't depend
          on fictres and pixelsx pixelsy
      - change nplot and Nplot by nodplot and NodPlot


NEXT VERSION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      - Include the line "new linked window" in the file menu
